If data was really big and it changes from time to time:
- Use jobs or different independent process and cron like scheduler to update the data periodically
- What if request happens while database is getting updated (create backup that serves until data is updated)

If data resource can change structure of data or make errors:
- Create data validation 
- Create system to save data that couldn't be parsed
